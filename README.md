# SH-Net
Code release for Scribble-attention Hierarchical Network for Weakly Supervised Salient Object Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Images.
# Training
## Requirements
1. Install Pytorch.
2. pip install -r requirements.txt.
## Training data
The training data can be downloaed from [(EORSSD) Dataset](https://github.com/rmcong/EORSSD-dataset).
## Pretrained weights for backbone
The pretrianed weight for backbone can be downloaded from [Res50](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1arzcXccUPW1QpvBrAaaBv1CapviBQAJL/view?usp=sharing).
# Test Model
1) Modify the testing image path accordingly.
2) Run ./test.py
# Our Results:
