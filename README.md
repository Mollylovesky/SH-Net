# SH-Net
Code release for Scribble-attention Hierarchical Network for Weakly Supervised Salient Object Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Images.
Code is coming soon...
# Training
## Requirements
1. Install Pytorch.
## Training data
The training data can be downloaed from [(EORSSD) Dataset](https://github.com/rmcong/EORSSD-dataset).
## Pretrained weights for backbone
The pretrianed weight for backbone can be downloaded from [VGG16].(https://github.com/rmcong/EORSSD-datasetï¼‰.
# Test Model
1) Modify the testing image path accordingly.
2) Run ./test.py
# Our Results:
